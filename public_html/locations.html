                    <h2>College Hall</h2>
                    <br>
					<h4>Paranormal Entity: Mildred Hedges</h4>
					Various sightings have reported the existence of a paranormal entity believed to be former home economics major, Mildred Hedges. According to the legend, Mildred fell to her death from the third floor of College Hall in May of 1935. Since this day, her ghost has haunted the building. Students have reported seeing this ghost looking out the windows while singing. Mildred is also believed to be responsible for the anomalous properties of the seal outside the building.
					
					<br><br>
					<h4>Paranormal Entity: The Simpson College Seal</h4>
					Outside of College Hall there is a metallic seal implanted into the sidewalk with the Simpson College logo on it. This seal is believed to be anomalous in nature, haunted by the ghost of Mildred Hedges. According to the reports, students who step on the seal perform inadequately on their next exam. Students have explained that they would get their tests back and notice inexplainable mistakes that they would never make otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>Paranormal Entity: Derdlim Hedges</h4>
                    Is believed to be the most terrifying ghost on Simpson's campus. This ghost is also believed to be Mildred's own twin brother. He was so devastated by what had happened to his sister that he wouldn't leave the north most room on the third floor. He eventually died in that very room and any time someone enters it they are trapped until you can convince him that you had nothing to do with his sisters death. To this very day he still remains in that room waiting for the day he gets to see his sister again. If you look close you can see him in the picture below.

					<h4>Paranormal Entity: Mildred Hedges</h4>
					Mary Berry used to be the dorm where Mildred Hedges lived. Since the incident of 1935 students have reported seeing her staring out the windows after closing hours. Faculty within the building have reported hearing unexplainable footsteps and noises.
					<br><br>
					<h4>Paranormal Entity: The Whiteboard of Room 120</h4>
					Students have reported sightings of strange drawings on the whiteboards of room 120. The drawings typically consist of smiley faces in the corners of the boards. According to one report, a student left the room after class, remembering the boards to be blank. A few minutes later, realizing that he forgot something, the student re-entered the room to find smiley faces in the corners of the board, without anybody nearby to draw them. The source of these drawings is believed to be from Mildred Hedges, but this is unconfirmed.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>Unconfirmed Rumor: The Lower Level Women's Restroom</h4>
                     Many students report overwhelming floral scents within the Women's Restroom on the ground floor of Mary Berry. This strong incense smell is believed to be the perfume of a since deceased professor. They say when she taught she would go into the restroom to refresh her perfume before every class.
