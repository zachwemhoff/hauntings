            <p class="lead">The Simpson Ghost Hunters investigate haunted locations and paranormal activity around the Simpson College campus. The organization was started in 2017 and since then has been busy investigating events all over the campus. These experiences are real and can be backed up with photos, witnesses and other forms of evidence. Our hunters have spent hours on lockdown inside these locations and are trained to defend themselves from the paranormal. Due to the unpredictable nature of these anomalous creatures, we highly advise that you never try this alone. Failure to investigate these areas without the proper training and equipment may lead to serious injury or death. If you believe that you have witnessed one of these anomalous creatures it is paramount that you reach out. Your life may very well be in danger depending on the what you have seen and experienced. Know that if you have had any experiences with these creatures and do not reach out you may be putting others in danger as well, some are known to attack indiscriminately.</p>
